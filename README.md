Python Implementation of Apriori Algorithm 
==========================================

Usage
-----
To run the program with dataset provided and default values for *minSupport* = 0.15 and *minConfidence* = 0.6

    python apriori.py -f INTEGRATED-DATASET.csv

To run program with dataset  

    python apriori.py -f INTEGRATED-DATASET.csv -s 0.17 -c 0.68

Best results are obtained for the following values of support and confidence:  

Support     : Between 0.1 and 0.2  

Confidence  : Between 0.5 and 0.7
